# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles, the backbone of my development and [PKM](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/) and [Obsidian Note-Taking](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/obsidian-note-taking-workflow/) workflow. Each dotfile here are fine-tuned to create an environment that's efficient for me, and, most importantly, give me joy workin in.

Most imprantant for my workflow I leverage a combination of `nvim`, `tmux`, and a tiling window manager orchestrated with `skhd` and `yabai`.

## Key Components
- **Editor** ([PDE](https://youtu.be/QMVIJhC9Veg)): [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
- Indent-color with [indent-blankline](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim)
- Tabs for buffers with [bufferline](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim)
- **Color Theme**: [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) (mix between [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)!). Announced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/rm92q6/kanagawanvim_if_gruvbox_and_tokyonight_had_a_baby/) on reddit
- **Multiplexer**: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- **Window Management**: Yabai, Skhd and Mission Control shortcuts for seamless navigation (more below)
- **Terminal**: [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- **Note-Taking**: Obsidian, where my Second Brain thrives

In one screen:
1. data integration/dbt code
2. analysis of SQL queries
3. db connections/browser
4. result of queries
5. docker build
6. dbt run
7. postgres
8. more windows/sessions (Tmux)




## [Obsidian](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/obsidian)

I made two of my own Themes, they are called [Kanagawa](https://github.com/sspaeti/obsidian_kanagawa) and [Ros√© Pine](https://github.com/sspaeti/obsidian_rose_pine).
Also check my YT video [how I use Obsidian](https://youtu.be/LQasaw4MkqE), in case that's interest you.

## Screen alignment

I have tried [many setups](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/computer-desk-setup-todays-office/), a single-screen (or one extra for meetings) has worked best with these shorcuts to switch betweent them instantly:

- `Alt+1`: Terminal for coding
- `Alt+2`: Obsidian for notes, thinking, writing, and my [Second Brain](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/)
- `Alt+3`: Browser for research and browsing needs
- `Alt+4`: Music, featuring Spotify and Focus@Will for all things auditory
- `Alt+5`: Collaboration tools like Slack, Asana, Nirvana, and my to-do lists
- `Alt+6`: Extra (when laptop screen is open): Additional screens for meetings with Zoom, etc.
- `Alt+7`: Extra (when laptop screen is open)
