# Dotfiles

Welcome to my realm of dotfiles, the cornerstone of my development and [personal knowledge management (PKM) workflows](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/). Each dotfile here are fine-tuned to create an environment that's efficient for me, and, most importantly, give me joy workin in.

I have many dotfiles, but most imprantly for my workflow I leverage a combination of `nvim`, `tmux`, and a tiling window manager orchestrated with `skhd` and `yabai`.

I made two of my own Themes, they are called [Kanagawa](https://github.com/sspaeti/obsidian_kanagawa) and [Ros√© Pine](https://github.com/sspaeti/obsidian_rose_pine).
Also check my YT video [how I use Obsidian](https://youtu.be/LQasaw4MkqE), in case that's interest you.

## Screen alignment

I have tried [many setups](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/computer-desk-setup-todays-office/), a single-screen (or one extra for meetings) has worked best with these shorcuts to switch betweent them instantly:

- `Alt+1`: Terminal for coding
- `Alt+2`: Obsidian for notes, thinking, writing, and my [Second Brain](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/)
- `Alt+3`: Browser for research and browsing needs
- `Alt+4`: Music, featuring Spotify and Focus@Will for all things auditory
- `Alt+5`: Collaboration tools like Slack, Asana, Nirvana, and my to-do lists
- `Alt+6`: Extra (when laptop screen is open): Additional screens for meetings with Zoom, etc.
- `Alt+7`: Extra (when laptop screen is open)
